# Exercise 3.2 
  
## Question:
Is the reinforcement learning framework adequate to usefully represent
all goal-directed learning tasks? Can you think of any clear exceptions?

## Answer:
No. It requires the agent to know of all actions it can take
at any point in time. It also requires a reward to be returned
in each state (0 reward isn't the same as null reward).
