# Exercise 3.11
  
## Question:
The value of a state depends on the the values of the actions possible
in that state and on how likely each action is to be taken under the current policy.

We can think of this in terms of a small backup diagram rooted at the state and
considering each possible action:

[See Question 3.11.png]

Give the equation corresponding to this intuition and diagram for the value at the
root node, v_pi(s), in terms of the value at the expected leaf node, q_pi(s; a), given
S_t = s. This expectation depends on the policy, pi. Then give a second equation in
which the expected value is written out explicitly in terms of pi(a|s) such that no
expected value notation appears in the equation.
