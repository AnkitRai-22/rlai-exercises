# Exercise 3.7
  
## Question:
What is the Bellman equation for action values, that is, for q_pi?
It must give the action value q_pi(s, a) in terms of the action values, q_pi(s', a'), of
possible successors to the state-action pair (s, a). As a hint, the backup diagram
corresponding to this equation is given in Figure 3.4b. Show the sequence of equations
analogous to (3.12), but for action values.
