# Exercise 3.9
  
## Question:
In the grid-world example, rewards are positive for goals, negative for
running into the edge of the world, and zero the rest of the time. Are the signs of
these rewards important, or only the intervals between them? Prove, using (3.2),
that adding a constant c to all the rewards adds a constant, v_c, to the values of all
states, and thus does not affect the relative values of any states under any policies.
What is v_c in terms of c and gamma?
