# Exercise 2.3 

## Question:
Design and conduct an experiment to demonstrate the difficulties that 
sample-average methods have for non-stationary problems. Use a modified 
version of the 10-armed testbed in which all the q*(a) start out equal and
then take independent random walks. Prepare plots like Figure 2.2 for an 
action-value method using sample averages, incrementally computed by 
alpha = 1/n, and another action-value method using a constant step-size 
parameter, alpha = 0.1. Use epsilon = 0.1 and, if necessary, runs 
longer than 1000 plays.
